<!--
The links to 0.0.3 and earlier go to the commit where the package.json
for the psl-parser was changed. The diffs are not usable as this project
contains a lot more than just the psl-parser.

The links for 0.0.1 and 0.0.2 point to the same commit, as the first occurrence
of the package.json already had the version set to 0.0.2
