# PSL Parser Build Information

This document discussed the various files and steps that are used to build this
project

## TypeScript Configuration Files

There are two different typescript configuration files in this project:

- [**tsconfig.json**](/tsconfig.json): TypeScript configuration file that
  compiles both the sources and tests.
- [**tsconfig.build.json**](/tsconfig.build.json): TypeScript configuration file
  that only compiles the sources.

## NPM Scripts

This section gives an overview of the various **npm** scripts that are
available.

| Script | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **clean** | Clean all output files generated by the compiler. |
| **precompile**| Runs before the compile. Runs the **clean** script. |
| **compile** | Runs the TypeScript compiler for both tests and sources. |
| **lint** | Runs **eslint** over the full project. |
| **watch** | Runs **build** in watch mode. |
| **pretest** | Runs before the test script. Runs the **compile** script. |
| **test** | Runs all tests using **jest**. |
| **dist** | Runs the TypeScript compiler for the source only, generating the distributed files. |
| **prebuild** | Runs before the build. Runs the **clean**, **lint** and **test** script, making sure the build is valid. |
| **build** | Generates a full build ready to be released. This script executes the **dist**, **generate-package-json** and **copy-extra-files-dist** scripts. |
| **generate-package-json** | This script will generate a trimmed down version of the package JSON file that will be shipped with the release. |
| **copy-extra-files-dist** | This script will copy files to the `dist/` directory that should be shipped with a release. |
| **release** | Release a new version of the PSL parser. This will call the **build** script and runs **npm publish**. |

## Development Steps

This section describes how to work on the project, and ultimately needs to be
transformed into a CONTRIBUTING guide for contributors and maintainers.

### Contributing to the Project

This section describes how to contribute any change to the project. If the
change is done in a fresh clone of the repository, make sure to run:

```shell
npm install
```

After that, the general workflow for any change is:

- Create a new branch from `main`.
- Apply the changes in this new branch. If any new changes affect source code,
  make sure the associated unit tests are either updated or created.
- Run `npm run lint`. This will run `eslint`, and find any inconsistencies in
  coding guidelines and quality.
- Run `npm run test`. This will compile the full project and run all test
  suites.
- If the previous two steps ran successful, the changes can be put up for review
  in a pull request.

### Releasing a New Version

This section is meant for those that maintain the main `ing-bank/psl-parser`
project, and describes how to create a new release. The following workflow
can be followed for a release:

- Make sure that the version in the [`package.json`](/package.json) is updated
  to the correct version
- Make sure the [`CHANGELOG.md`](/CHANGELOG.md) is updated with the latest
  changes, and that a new empty **Unreleased** section is added.
- Create a new release in GitHub:
  - As tag, use `vx.y.z` for version `x.y.z` in the `package.json` file.
  - As release name, use `Release x.y.z`.
  - For release notes, generate them first, as this will give a nice overview
    of pull request and issues that are in the release, and makes the
    contributes visible. In addition to the generate release notes add a link
    to the section of this release in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

Github actions that are running on tags that start with a `v` will run, which
will run

```shell
npm run release
```

This script will go through all the steps to release (lint, compile, test,
build and publish).
